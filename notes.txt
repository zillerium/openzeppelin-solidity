ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@server.com
start ganache-cli and have localhost running
then use ssh to connect to local machine
this can then be accessed via metamask and localhost
also remixd can be used to accessed source code via localhost if the source
code on the server is copied down using scp (after generation from the zksnarks toolkit)
